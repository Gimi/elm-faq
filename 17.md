### Where are the official documents about Elm version 0.17?

* [A Farewell to FRP][farewell]: Evan's blog announcement of Elm 0.17.
* [Upgrading to 0.17][upgrade guide]: The official upgrade guide.
* [Introduction to Elm][guide]: The official guide to the Elm 0.17 language and core packages.

Others have written about the conversion as well:

* [Migrating signal usage from Elm 0.16 to 0.17](http://noredink.github.io/posts/signalsmigration.html)

### Where is the evancz/elm-html package?

It's now at elm-lang/html. See the [upgrade guide] about this and other core packages that moved.

[upgrade guide]: https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.17.md
[guide]: http://guide.elm-lang.org/

### Where is `Effects.task`?

It's gone. `Task.perform` is used instead.

### Why am I getting "TypeError: Elm.embed is not a function"?

The JavaScript code for calling the Elm entry point must now look like this:

```javascript
Elm.MyApp.embed(someElement);
```

It used to look like `Elm.embed(Elm.MyApp, someElement)`.

It's similar for the `fullscreen` function.

### Where is the Graphics package?

evancz/elm-graphics

### Where are the `Cmd` and `Sub` types defined?

They are defined in the core
[Platform.Cmd](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.0/Platform-Cmd)
and
[Platform.Sub](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.0/Platform-Sub)
modules.

### Why am I getting "cannot find module" errors while upgrading a project from 0.16?

Cached or obsolete/renamed package versions may be getting in the way. To get a clean start, try these (from simplest to most drastic):

1. Remove all of elm-stuff.
2. Remove all the package names from the `dependencies` section of elm-package.json and install packages again as needed. You may have to explicitly install elm-lang/core again.
3. Remove all of ~/.elm (on linux or Mac OSX) or ~/AppData/Roaming/elm/package (on Windows).

### What is this `! []` construct in the code?

The `!` operator is defined as a convenience function in the [Platform-Cmd](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.0/Platform-Cmd#!) module.

Called as `model ! listOfSubs` it returns the `(model, sub)` value needed as the return value of an `update` function.

### Does hot-reloading work in elm-reactor now?

Not yet. Work is well underway to improve elm-reactor.

### What is the difference between `Cmd Msg` and `Cmd msg`?

`Cmd Msg` is a type of command where the resulting messages are of type `Msg`. 

`Cmd msg` is a more general type of command where the resulting message type is not known. It could just as well be written as `Cmd a` or `Cmd x`.

### Why does the compiler complain that "You are declaring port \`someName\` in a normal module."?

Any module using ports must start with `port module` on the first line.
