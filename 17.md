This page concerns questions that arose with Elm version 0.17.

For general questions see the [main FAQ page](index.html).

### Where are the official documents about Elm version 0.17?

* [A Farewell to FRP][farewell]: Evan's blog announcement of Elm 0.17.
* [Upgrading to 0.17][upgrade guide]: The official upgrade guide.
* [Introduction to Elm][guide]: The official guide to the Elm 0.17 language and core packages.

Others have written about the conversion as well:

* [Migrating signal usage from Elm 0.16 to 0.17](http://noredink.github.io/posts/signalsmigration.html)

### Why does elm-make complain "Cannot find module 'Basics'"?

You need to install the elm-lang/core package.

This often arises when upgrading a package from 0.16 after removing all dependencies from elm-package.json.

### Where is the evancz/elm-html package?

It's now at elm-lang/html. See the [upgrade guide] about this and other core packages that moved.

[farewell]: http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp
[upgrade guide]: https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.17.md
[guide]: http://guide.elm-lang.org/

### Where is `Effects.task`?

It's gone. `Task.perform` is used instead.

See some examples of [how to convert to Task.perform](17-tasks.html).

### Why am I getting "TypeError: Elm.embed is not a function"?

The JavaScript code for calling the Elm entry point must now look like this:

```javascript
Elm.MyApp.embed(someElement);
```

It used to look like `Elm.embed(Elm.MyApp, someElement)`.

It's similar for the `fullscreen` and `worker` functions.

### What happened to all the core modules?

Many core modules have been moved out into separate packages, usually under `elm-lang`.

* `Graphics` is now in `evancz/elm-graphics`
* `Trampoline` is now in `elm-lang/trampoline` and has some renames
  * `Trampoline.trampoline` is now `Trampoline.evaluate`
  * `Trampoline.Done` is now `Trampoline.done` (function instead of constructor)
  * `Trampoline.Continue` is now `Trampoline.jump` (function instead of constructor)
* `Mouse` is now in `elm-lang/mouse`
* `Window` is now in `elm-lang/window`
* `Keyboard` is now in `elm-lang/keyboard`

Also:

* `maxsnew/lazy` is now `elm-lang/lazy`

### What is now in elm-community?

* `NoRedInk/elm-lazy-list` is now `elm-community/elm-lazy-list`
* `NoRedInk/elm-random-extra` is now `elm-community/elm-random-extra`
  * `Random.Bool` has been removed as it is now in `elm-lang/core`'s `Random`
  * `Random.Function` has been removed entirely
* `deadfoxygrandpa/elm-test` is now `elm-community/elm-test`
  * It no longer depends on `laszlopandy/elm-console`. To run tests in node use: `ElmTest.runSuite`
  * `elementRunner` is gone, use `runSuiteHtml` instead

### Where are the `Cmd` and `Sub` types defined?

They are defined in the core
[Platform.Cmd](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.0/Platform-Cmd)
and
[Platform.Sub](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.0/Platform-Sub)
modules.

### Why am I getting "cannot find module" errors while upgrading a project from 0.16?

Cached or obsolete/renamed package versions may be getting in the way. To get a clean start, try these (from simplest to most drastic):

1. Remove all of elm-stuff.
2. Remove all the package names from the `dependencies` section of elm-package.json and install packages again as needed. You may have to explicitly install elm-lang/core again.
3. Remove all of ~/.elm (on linux or Mac OSX) or ~/AppData/Roaming/elm/package (on Windows).

### What is this `! []` construct in the code?

The `!` operator is defined as a convenience function in the [Platform-Cmd](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.0/Platform-Cmd#!) module.

Called as `model ! listOfCmds` it returns the `(model, cmd)` value needed as the return value of an `update` function.

### Does hot-reloading work in elm-reactor now?

Not yet. Work is well underway to improve elm-reactor.

### What is the difference between `Cmd Msg` and `Cmd msg`?

`Cmd Msg` is a type of command where the resulting messages are of type `Msg`.

`Cmd msg` is a more general type of command where the resulting message type is not known. It could just as well be written as `Cmd a` or `Cmd x`.

### Why does the compiler complain that "You are declaring port \`someName\` in a normal module."?

Any module using ports must start with `port module` on the first line.

### Why does the compiler complain about "I am looking for one of the following things: whitespace" near the beginning of the file?

The `exposing` clause is now required at the beginning of each module.
For example, you now need `module Foo exposing (..)` where prior to Elm 0.17 you could use `module Foo where`.

### How do I generate a new message as a command?

Sending a new message this way is often not necessary. The same effect can often be had by calling the update function recursively with the new message.
The functions in the
[ccapndave/elm-update-extra](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ccapndave/elm-update-extra/latest) package aid in doing that, chaining several messages and related update actions together.


That said, you can send the `Test` message to yourself with this:

```haskell
Task.perform (\_ -> (Debug.crash "fail")) identity (Task.succeed Test)
```

Alternatively, you can use the fact that the failure case should not happen for `Task.succeed` like this:

```haskell
Task.perform identity identity (Task.succeed Test)
```

There is also the `performFailproof` function in [NoRedInk/elm-task-extra](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-task-extra/latest):

```haskell
Task.Extra.performFailproof identity (Task.succeed Test)
```



### Are static ports still available?

No. In Elm 0.17 you'll have to pass any static data from JS to Elm via the "flags" argument to the `embed()`, `fullscreen()`, or `worker()` functions.

### Why does elm-make report "I cannot find module 'Graphics.Collage'" even though evancz/elm-graphics is installed?

You now need to do `import Collage` to get that module. It's no longer namespaced under `Graphics`.

### What is the difference between Cmd and Task?

- `Cmd` is just a bag (i.e. multiset) of chunks of data. It is a functor, but it is not applicative or monadic. This means all you can do is apply a function to all the entries in the bag with `map` and add to the bag with `batch`.

- `Task` is a way doing things in sequence. It is monadic, meaning it has an `andThen` in the API. This means you can say "Do X, and depending on the result, do Y or Z." From there you can keep chaining things.

The point of this bag of commands is that you can gather all the things that need to happen from your whole app and get them done. The point of a task is to describe a particular thing you want to happen.[^cmd-vs-task]

[^cmd-vs-task]: From Evan's #elm-dev Slack posting, 2016-05-16.

If you need to do any kind of chaining stuff, use `Task`, and don't turn your task chain into a `Cmd` until you have no more chaining stuff to do.
This is why APIs generally expose `Task` instances rather than `Cmd`:  so you can do all the chaining you like, and you're in charge of finishing the job and turning whatever chain you've constructed into a `Cmd`.[^task-chaining]
