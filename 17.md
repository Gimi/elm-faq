### Where are the official documents about Elm version 0.17?

* [A Farewell to FRP][farewell]: Evan's blog announcement of Elm 0.17.
* [Upgrading to 0.17][upgrade guide]: The official upgrade guide.
* [Introduction to Elm][guide]: The official guide to the Elm 0.17 language and core packages.

Others have written about the conversion as well:

* [Migrating signal usage from Elm 0.16 to 0.17](http://noredink.github.io/posts/signalsmigration.html)

### Why does elm-make complain "Cannot find module 'Basics'"?

You need to install the elm-lang/core package.

This often arises when upgrading a package from 0.16 after removing all dependencies from elm-package.json.

### Where is the evancz/elm-html package?

It's now at elm-lang/html. See the [upgrade guide] about this and other core packages that moved.

[farewell]: http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp
[upgrade guide]: https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.17.md
[guide]: http://guide.elm-lang.org/

### Where is `Effects.task`?

It's gone. `Task.perform` is used instead.

### Why am I getting "TypeError: Elm.embed is not a function"?

The JavaScript code for calling the Elm entry point must now look like this:

```javascript
Elm.MyApp.embed(someElement);
```

It used to look like `Elm.embed(Elm.MyApp, someElement)`.

It's similar for the `fullscreen` function.

### What happened to all the core modules?

Many core modules have been moved out into separate packages, usually under `elm-lang`.

* `Graphics` is now in `evancz/elm-graphics`
* `Trampoline` is now in `elm-lang/trampoline` and has some renames
  * `Trampoline.trampoline` is now `Trampoline.evaluate`
  * `Trampoline.Done` is now `Trampoline.done` (function instead of type)
  * `Trampoline.Continue` is now `Trampoline.continue` (function instead of type)
* `Mouse` is now in `elm-lang/Mouse`
* `Window` is now in `elm-lang/Window`

### Where are the `Cmd` and `Sub` types defined?

They are defined in the core
[Platform.Cmd](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.0/Platform-Cmd)
and
[Platform.Sub](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.0/Platform-Sub)
modules.

### Why am I getting "cannot find module" errors while upgrading a project from 0.16?

Cached or obsolete/renamed package versions may be getting in the way. To get a clean start, try these (from simplest to most drastic):

1. Remove all of elm-stuff.
2. Remove all the package names from the `dependencies` section of elm-package.json and install packages again as needed. You may have to explicitly install elm-lang/core again.
3. Remove all of ~/.elm (on linux or Mac OSX) or ~/AppData/Roaming/elm/package (on Windows).

### What is this `! []` construct in the code?

The `!` operator is defined as a convenience function in the [Platform-Cmd](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.0/Platform-Cmd#!) module.

Called as `model ! listOfCmds` it returns the `(model, cmd)` value needed as the return value of an `update` function.

### Does hot-reloading work in elm-reactor now?

Not yet. Work is well underway to improve elm-reactor.

### What is the difference between `Cmd Msg` and `Cmd msg`?

`Cmd Msg` is a type of command where the resulting messages are of type `Msg`.

`Cmd msg` is a more general type of command where the resulting message type is not known. It could just as well be written as `Cmd a` or `Cmd x`.

### Why does the compiler complain that "You are declaring port \`someName\` in a normal module."?

Any module using ports must start with `port module` on the first line.

### Why does the compiler complain about "I am looking for one of the following things: whitespace" near the beginning of the file?

The `exposing` clause is now required at the beginning of each module.
For example, you now need `module Foo exposing (..)` where prior to Elm 0.17 you could use `module Foo where`.

### How do I generate a new message as a command?

This is not recommended to do; it's an anti-pattern. The same effect can often be had by calling the update function recursively.

If you still insist, you can send the `Test` message to yourself with this horror:

```haskell
Task.perform (\_ -> (Debug.crash "fail")) (always Test) (Task.succeed ())
```

### Are static ports still available?

No. In Elm 0.17 you'll have to pass any static data from JS to Elm via the "flags" argument to the `embed()`, `fullscreen()`, or `worker()` functions.

### What is now in elm-community?

* `NoRedInk/elm-lazy-list` is now `elm-community/elm-lazy-list`
* `maxsnew/lazy` is now `elm-community/lazy`
* `NoRedInk/elm-random-extra` is now `elm-community/elm-random-extra`
  * `Random.Bool` has been removed as it is now in `elm-lang/core`'s `Random`
  * `Random.Function` has been removed entirely
* `deadfoxygrandpa/elm-test` is now `elm-community/elm-test`
  * It no longer needs `Console` to run under node, use `ElmTest.runSuite`
  * `elementRunner` is gone, use `runSuiteHtml` instead
