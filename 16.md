**Warning: This page concerns Elm version 0.16.**
The information here is no longer correct for the current version of Elm.

For general questions about the current version see the [main FAQ page](index.html).


### Why does elm-repl (or elm-make) report "cannot find module 'Html'"?
You need to install the Html module:

    elm package install evancz/elm-html

Several modules are [available by default](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest) in the base Elm tools but other common modules like Html have to be installed in the working directory before they can be used in elm-make, elm-repl, and elm-reactor.


### How do I generate an Action as an Effect?

    Effects.task (Task.succeed SomeAction)


### Why isn't my StartApp-based program running any tasks?

You need to set `app.port`.

```haskell
port tasks : Signal (Task.Task Never ())
port tasks =
    app.tasks
```


### Why doesn't the `<~` operator work?

It was removed in Elm version 0.16. You can still get it (or the equivalent `andMap`) from
[Signal.Extra](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Apanatshka/elm-signal-extra/latest/Signal-Extra)
instead.


### Why doesn't my application get the initial value of Window.dimensions?

For example, given this:

```haskell
modelInit = { window = (-1,-1) }

main = Signal.map Element.show model

model = Signal.foldp (\d s -> {s | window = d}) modelInit Window.dimensions
```

the displayed value will remain at "{ window = (-1,-1) }" until the window is resized, at which time the display tracks all changes.

This arises because `Signal.foldp` does not use the initial value of its input signal (`Window.dimensions` in this case).

One solution is to use the `foldp'` function from the Apanatshka/elm-signal-extra package, as follows:

```haskell
model = Signal.Extra.foldp' (\d s -> {s | window = d}) (\d -> { window = d }) Window.dimensions
```

Whereas `foldp` takes an initial value parameter, `foldp'` takes instead a function from the initial value of the input signal to the initial value returned by `foldp'`.

Since StartApp uses `foldp` this problem with initial values can arise when it is used. Also, the problem is not specific to Window.dimensions; it can arise for any input signal whose initial value is of interest.



### Why is my app failing immediately saying "Cannot read property 'make' of undefined"?

That can happen if you write custom Javascript code to call `Elm.embed()` or `Elm.fullscreen()` and the application name used there (the first parameter) does not match the main module name.

For example, if Foo.elm contains the `main` function for your app then your Javascript code should call it like this:

```javascript
app = Elm.embed(Elm.Foo, ...)
```

If you use a name other than `Elm.Foo` there you will likely get that "Cannot read property" error.
